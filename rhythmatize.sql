The band\'s lineup comprises vocalist/rhythm guitarist/keyboardist Mike Shinoda, lead guitarist Brad Delson, bassist Dave Farrell, DJ/turntablist Joe Hahn and drummer Rob Bourdon, with vocalist Chester Bennington also part of the band until his death. Vocalist Mark Wakefield was an early member prior to Bennington\'s recruitment. Categorized as alternative rock, Linkin Park\'s earlier music spanned a fusion of heavy metal and hip hop, while their later music features more electronica and pop elements.\n\nFormed in 1996, Linkin Park rose to international fame with their debut studio album, Hybrid Theory (2000), which became certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Released during the peak of the nu metal scene, the album\'s singles\' heavy airplay on MTV led the singles \"One Step Closer\", \"Crawling\" and \"In the End\" all to chart highly on the US Mainstream Rock chart. The lattermost also crossed over to the nation\'s Billboard Hot 100. Their second album, Meteora (2003), continued the band\'s success. The band explored experimental sounds on their third album, Minutes to Midnight (2007). By the end of the decade, Linkin Park was among the most successful and popular rock acts.\n\nThe band continued to explore a wider variation of musical types on their fourth album, A Thousand Suns (2010), layering their music with more electronic sounds. The band\'s fifth album, Living Things (2012), combined musical elements from all of their previous records. Their sixth album, The Hunting Party (2014), returned to a heavier rock sound, and their seventh album, One More Light (2017), was a substantially more pop-oriented record. Linkin Park went on a hiatus when longtime lead vocalist Bennington died in July 2017. In April 2022, Shinoda revealed the band was neither working on new music nor planning on touring for the foreseeable future, and have only released 20th-anniversary editions of their first two studio albums since Bennington\'s death.\n\nLinkin Park is among the best-selling bands of the 21st century and the world\'s best-selling music artists, having sold over 100 million records worldwide. They have won two Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, two Billboard Music Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, 10 MTV Europe Music Awards and three World Music Awards. In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth-greatest band of the music video era and the third-best of the new millennium. Billboard ranked Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade list. In 2012, the band was voted as the greatest artist of the 2000s in a Bracket Madness poll on VH1. In 2014, the band was declared as \"The Biggest Rock Band in the World Right Now\" by Kerrang!.', 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZU9T1ceaOgwfLRq7OKFU4Q', 'https://open.spotify.com/artist/6XyY86QOPPrYVGvF9ch6wz?si=fO_R2hOWTc2-WGEzk0T9sg', 'https://music.apple.com/us/artist/linkin-park/148662'),

He is credited with popularizing hip hop in Middle America and is regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time. \n\nHis global success is regarded as having broken racial barriers for the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. While much of his transgressive work during the late 1990s and early 2000s made him a controversial figure, he came to be a representation of popular angst of the American underclass and has been cited as an influence by and upon many artists working in various genres.\n\nAfter the release of his debut album Infinite (1996) and the extended play Slim Shady EP (1997), Eminem signed with Dr. Dre\'s Aftermath Entertainment and subsequently achieved mainstream popularity in 1999 with The Slim Shady LP. His next two releases, The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) and The Eminem Show (2002), were worldwide successes and were both nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year.

Known as the \"King of Pop\", he is widely regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. During his four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture. Jackson influenced artists across many music genres. Through stage and video performances, he popularized complicated street dance moves such as the moonwalk, which he named, as well as the robot.\r\n\r\nThe eighth child of the Jackson family, Jackson made his public debut in 1964 with his older brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5 (later known as the Jacksons). Jackson began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records. He became a solo star with his 1979 album Off the Wall. His music videos, including those for \"Beat It\", \"Billie Jean\", and \"Thriller\" from his 1982 album Thriller, are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool. He helped propel the success of MTV and continued to innovate with the videos for his subsequent albums: Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991), HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I (1995), and Invincible (2001). Thriller became the best-selling album of all time, while Bad was the first album to produce five US Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles.\r\n\r\nFrom the late 1980s, Jackson became a figure of controversy and speculation due to his changing appearance, relationships, behavior, and lifestyle. In 1993, he was accused of sexually abusing the child of a family friend. The lawsuit was settled out of civil court; Jackson was not indicted due to lack of evidence. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges. The FBI found no evidence of criminal conduct by Jackson in either case. In 2009, while he was preparing for a series of comeback concerts, This Is It, Jackson died from an overdose of propofol administered by his personal physician, Conrad Murray, who was convicted in 2011 of involuntary manslaughter for his involvement in Jackson\'s death. His death triggered reactions around the world, creating unprecedented surges of internet traffic and a spike in sales of his music. Jackson\'s televised memorial service, held at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, was estimated to have been viewed by more than 2.5 billion people.\r\n\r\nJackson is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with sales estimated around 500 million records worldwide.[nb 2] He had 13 Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles (fourth highest of any artist in the Hot 100 era) and was the first artist to have a top-ten single on the Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades.

He is known for his unconventional music production, artistic reinventions, and signature use of the falsetto register.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Tesfaye expressed his interest in music when he began anonymously releasing music on YouTube. Two years later, he co-founded the record label XO and released the mixtapes House of Balloons, Thursday, and Echoes of Silence, which gained recognition for his unique style of contemporary and alternative R&B and the mystery surrounding his identity. In 2012, Tesfaye signed with Republic Records and re-issued the mixtapes for his compilation album Trilogy. He explored the dark wave genre for his debut studio album Kiss Land (2013), which debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200. After its release, Tesfaye began contributing to film soundtracks. His 2014 single \"Earned It\" from Fifty Shades of Grey (2015) won the Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song.\r\n\r\nTesfaye earned critical and commercial success with his pop-leaning second album, Beauty Behind the Madness (2015), which reached number one in the US, contained the US Billboard Hot 100 chart-topping singles \"Can\'t Feel My Face\" and \"The Hills\", and won the Grammy Award for Best Urban Contemporary Album in addition to a nomination for Album of the Year. Experimenting with multiple genres led to his third album, Starboy (2016), which also saw commercial success. It included the US number-one eponymous lead single (featuring Daft Punk) and \"Die for You\", earning it the Grammy Award for Best Urban Contemporary Album. Tesfaye returned to alternative R&B with his debut extended play, My Dear Melancholy (2018), which contained the US top-ten single \"Call Out My Name\". He explored new wave and dream pop with his fourth studio album, After Hours (2020), which featured the chart record-setting single \"Blinding Lights\" along with two US number-one singles, \"Heartless\" and \"Save Your Tears\". Tesfaye began exploring dance-pop, leading to his fifth album, Dawn FM (2022), which included the US top-ten single \"Take My Breath\". In 2023, he co-created and starred in the drama series The Idol, which was critically panned, although its accompanying soundtrack found modest commercial success.\r\n\r\nOne of the world\'s best-selling music artists with over 75 million records sold, Tesfaye holds several streaming and Billboard chart records. He is the first Canadian artist to earn four diamond-certified singles from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and is the first artist to simultaneously hold the top three spots on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. \"Blinding Lights\" became the most-streamed song in Spotify history, the best-performing song in the Billboard Hot 100\'s history and the longest-charting song by a solo artist on the Billboard Hot 100. Tesfaye was listed by Time as one of the world\'s most influential people in 2020 and was dubbed the \"world\'s most popular artist\" by Guinness World Records in 2023. An advocate for racial equality and food security, he was appointed a World Food Programme Goodwill Ambassador in 2021. His accolades include four Grammy Awards, 20 Billboard Music Awards, 22 Juno Awards, six American Music Awards, three MTV Video Music Awards, a Latin Grammy Award and nominations for an Academy Award and a Primetime Emmy Award.', 'https://music.youtube.com/channel/UClYV6hHlupm_S_ObS1W-DYw', 'https://open.spotify.com/artist/1Xyo4u8uXC1ZmMpatF05PJ', 'https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-weeknd/479756766'),

The band consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Patrick Stump, bassist Pete Wentz, lead guitarist Joe Trohman, and drummer Andy Hurley. \r\n\r\nThe band originated from Chicago\'s hardcore punk scene and was formed by Wentz and Trohman as a pop-punk side project; Stump joined shortly thereafter. The group went through a succession of drummers before Hurley joined. Their debut album, Take This to Your Grave (2003), became an underground success and helped the band gain a dedicated fanbase through heavy touring. Take This to Your Grave is cited as influential on pop-punk music in the 2000s.\r\n\r\nWith Wentz as the band\'s lyricist and Stump as the primary composer, Fall Out Boy\'s 2005 major-label breakthrough, From Under the Cork Tree, produced two hit singles, \"Sugar, We\'re Goin Down\" and \"Dance, Dance\". It went double platinum, transforming the group into superstars and making Wentz a celebrity and tabloid fixture. Fall Out Boy received a Best New Artist nomination at the 2006 Grammy Awards. Infinity on High (2007) debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with 260,000 first week sales. It produced two worldwide hit singles, \"This Ain\'t a Scene, It\'s an Arms Race\" and \"Thnks fr th Mmrs\". Their following album, Folie à Deux (2008), was a commercial disappointment and received a mixed response. Following the release of Believers Never Die – Greatest Hits in 2009, the band went on hiatus and the members worked on side projects.\r\n\r\nThe band reunited with Save Rock and Roll (2013), which became Fall Out Boy\'s second number-one album, and included the top 20 single \"My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up)\". The same year, the band released the EP PAX AM Days, consisting of 8 punk-influenced tracks that were recorded during a two-day session with producer Ryan Adams. The band\'s sixth studio album, American Beauty/American Psycho (2015) peaked at number one on the Billboard 200, and spawned the top-10 hit \"Centuries\" and the single \"Uma Thurman\" which reached No. 22 on the Billboard Hot 100. This was followed by their first remix album Make America Psycho Again, which featured remixes of all original tracks from American Beauty/American Psycho by a different artist on each song, including Migos and Wiz Khalifa.\r\n\r\nThe band\'s seventh studio album Mania (2018), also peaked at No. 1, making it the band\'s fourth No. 1 album and sixth consecutive top 10 album. The Mania tour included a show at Wrigley Field, marking their first headlining stadium show.[3] In 2018, Fall Out Boy also received their second Grammy nomination for Best Rock Album for Mania. On January 18, 2023, the group announced its eighth studio album, So Much (for) Stardust, which was released on March 24.', 'https://music.youtube.com/channel/UC0NqJ6MhRnkRaWAmBgyyjTA', 'https://open.spotify.com/artist/4UXqAaa6dQYAk18Lv7PEgX', 'https://music.apple.com/us/artist/fall-out-boy/28673423'),

Since their departure, the line-up has consisted of Joseph and drummer Josh Dun. The duo is best known for their singles \"Stressed Out\", \"Ride\", and \"Heathens\", which achieved commercial success between 2015 and 2016. The duo received a Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards for \"Stressed Out\".\r\n\r\nStarting out, the band independently released two albums, Twenty One Pilots (2009) and Regional at Best (2011), before being signed by record label Fueled by Ramen in 2012. Their label debut Vessel (2013) became the second album in history on which every track received at least a gold certification, making Twenty One Pilots the first and only band in the history of music to see every song on two albums earn gold or platinum awards.\r\n\r\nThe duo achieved breakthrough success with their fourth album, Blurryface (2015), which produced the hit singles \"Stressed Out\" and \"Ride\" and became the first album on which every track received at least a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. The release of \"Heathens\" also made the group the first alternative artist in history to have two concurrent top five singles in the Billboard Hot 100 and the third rock act in history to have two singles simultaneously chart in the top five of the Billboard Hot 100, joining the Beatles and Elvis Presley.\r\n\r\nThe duo released their fifth album, Trench, in 2018 and their sixth album, Scaled and Icy, in 2021. Their upcoming seventh album, Clancy, is set to be released in 2024.
