Vocalist Mark Wakefield was an early member prior to Bennington\'s recruitment. Categorized as alternative rock, Linkin Park\'s earlier music spanned a fusion of heavy metal and hip hop, while their later music features more electronica and pop elements.\n\nFormed in 1996, Linkin Park rose to international fame with their debut studio album, Hybrid Theory (2000), which became certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Released during the peak of the nu metal scene, the album\'s singles\' heavy airplay on MTV led the singles \"One Step Closer\", \"Crawling\" and \"In the End\" all to chart highly on the US Mainstream Rock chart. The lattermost also crossed over to the nation\'s Billboard Hot 100. Their second album, Meteora (2003), continued the band\'s success. The band explored experimental sounds on their third album, Minutes to Midnight (2007). By the end of the decade, Linkin Park was among the most successful and popular rock acts.\n\nThe band continued to explore a wider variation of musical types on their fourth album, A Thousand Suns (2010), layering their music with more electronic sounds. The band\'s fifth album, Living Things (2012), combined musical elements from all of their previous records. Their sixth album, The Hunting Party (2014), returned to a heavier rock sound, and their seventh album, One More Light (2017), was a substantially more pop-oriented record. Linkin Park went on a hiatus when longtime lead vocalist Bennington died in July 2017. In April 2022, Shinoda revealed the band was neither working on new music nor planning on touring for the foreseeable future, and have only released 20th-anniversary editions of their first two studio albums since Bennington\'s death.\n\nLinkin Park is among the best-selling bands of the 21st century and the world\'s best-selling music artists, having sold over 100 million records worldwide. They have won two Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, two Billboard Music Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, 10 MTV Europe Music Awards and three World Music Awards.

He signed with Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE) in 2005, where he co-founded the hip hop supergroup Black Hippy. Following the success of his alternative rap debut album Section.80 (2011), Lamar secured a joint contract with Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. He rose to prominence with his gangsta rap-influenced second album Good Kid, M.A.A.D City (2012) and its top 40 singles \"Swimming Pools (Drank)\", \"Poetic Justice\" and \"Bitch, Don\'t Kill My Vibe\". It is the longest-charting hip hop studio album on the Billboard 200, spending over ten consecutive years on the chart.\r\n\r\nInspired by a visit to South Africa, Lamar embraced jazz and G-funk styles on his third album, To Pimp a Butterfly (2015). It became his first of four consecutive number-one albums in the U.S., and is one of the most critically acclaimed albums of the 2010s decade. His work on the remix of \"Bad Blood\" (by Taylor Swift) garnered his first number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. Lamar\'s critical and commercial success continued with his R&B and pop-leaning fourth album Damn (2017), yielding his second chart-topping single \"Humble\". He curated the soundtrack album for the film Black Panther (2018), left TDE through Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers (2022), and scored his third number-one single with \"Like That\" (2024; with Future and Metro Boomin).\r\n\r\nLamar has received various accolades throughout his career, including one Primetime Emmy Award, one Brit Award, four American Music Awards, six Billboard Music Awards, 11 MTV Video Music Awards (including two Video of the Year wins), 17 Grammy Awards (the third-most won by a rapper), and 29 BET Hip Hop Awards (the most won by any artist).

Known as the \"King of Pop\", he is widely regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. During his four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture. Jackson influenced artists across many music genres. Through stage and video performances, he popularized complicated street dance moves such as the moonwalk, which he named, as well as the robot.\r\n\r\nThe eighth child of the Jackson family, Jackson made his public debut in 1964 with his older brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5 (later known as the Jacksons). Jackson began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records. He became a solo star with his 1979 album Off the Wall. His music videos, including those for \"Beat It\", \"Billie Jean\", and \"Thriller\" from his 1982 album Thriller, are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool. He helped propel the success of MTV and continued to innovate with the videos for his subsequent albums: Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991), HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I (1995), and Invincible (2001). Thriller became the best-selling album of all time, while Bad was the first album to produce five US Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles.\r\n\r\nFrom the late 1980s, Jackson became a figure of controversy and speculation due to his changing appearance, relationships, behavior, and lifestyle. In 1993, he was accused of sexually abusing the child of a family friend. The lawsuit was settled out of civil court; Jackson was not indicted due to lack of evidence. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges. The FBI found no evidence of criminal conduct by Jackson in either case. In 2009, while he was preparing for a series of comeback concerts, This Is It, Jackson died from an overdose of propofol administered by his personal physician, Conrad Murray, who was convicted in 2011 of involuntary manslaughter for his involvement in Jackson\'s death. His death triggered reactions around the world, creating unprecedented surges of internet traffic and a spike in sales of his music. Jackson\'s televised memorial service, held at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, was estimated to have been viewed by more than 2.5 billion people.\r\n\r\nJackson is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with sales estimated around 500 million records worldwide.[nb 2] He had 13 Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles (fourth highest of any artist in the Hot 100 era) and was the first artist to have a top-ten single on the Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades. His honors include 15 Grammy Awards, six Brit Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and 39 Guinness World Records, including the \"Most Successful Entertainer of All Time\". Jackson\'s inductions include the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (twice), the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, the Songwriters Hall of Fame, the Dance Hall of Fame (making him the only recording artist to be inducted) and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame.', 'https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCoIOOL7QKuBhQHVKL8y7BEQ', 'https://open.spotify.com/artist/3fMbdgg4jU18AjLCKBhRSm', 'https://music.apple.com/us/artist/michael-jackson/32940'),

Their earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock, and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock.\r\n\r\nBefore forming Queen, May and Taylor had played together in the band Smile. Mercury was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. He joined in 1970 and suggested the name \"Queen\". Deacon was recruited in February 1971, before the band released their self-titled debut album in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II, in 1974. Sheer Heart Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 brought them international success. The latter featured \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and helped popularise the music video format. The band\'s 1977 album News of the World contained \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions\", which have become anthems at sporting events. By the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest stadium rock bands in the world. \"Another One Bites the Dust\" from The Game (1980) became their best-selling single, while their 1981 compilation album Greatest Hits is the best-selling album in the UK and is certified nine times platinum in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Their performance at the 1985 Live Aid concert is ranked among the greatest in rock history by various publications. In August 1986, Mercury gave his last performance with Queen at Knebworth, England.\r\n\r\nThough he kept his condition private, Mercury was diagnosed with AIDS in 1987. The band released two more albums, The Miracle in 1989 and Innuendo in 1991. On 23 November 1991, Mercury publicly revealed that he had AIDS, and the next day died of bronchopneumonia, a complication of AIDS. One more album was released featuring Mercury\'s vocal, 1995\'s Made in Heaven. John Deacon retired in 1997, while May and Taylor continued to make sporadic appearances together. Since 2004, they have toured as \"Queen +\", with vocalists Paul Rodgers and Adam Lambert.\r\n\r\nQueen have been a global presence in popular culture for more than half a century. Estimates of their record sales range from 250 million to 300 million, making them one of the world\'s best-selling music artists. In 1990, Queen received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, and with each member having composed hit singles, all four were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003. In 2005, they received the Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Song Collection from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors, and in 2018 were presented the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.', 'https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCEPMVbUzImPl4p8k4LkGevA', 'https://open.spotify.com/artist/1dfeR4HaWDbWqFHLkxsg1d', 'https://music.apple.com/us/artist/queen/3296287');

The group went through a succession of drummers before Hurley joined.

swine\r\nTryna clean up the streets from all these minorities\r\nThat\'s what we call \'em pigsties for\r\nThey\'re like eyesores to police\r\nTalk to you like just a piece of trash\r\nFeels like we\'re stuck in a time warp to me\r\nAs I kick these facts and get these mixed reactions\r\nAs this beat backspins, it\'s like we\'re drifting back in\r\nTo the \'60s, having black skin is risky\r\n\'Cause this keeps happening\r\nThroughout history\r\nAfrican-Americans have been treated like shit\r\nAnd I admit\r\nThere have been times where it\'s been embarrassin\' to be a...\r\n\r\nWhite boy, white boy, you\'re a rockstar\r\n(My momma talkin\' to me, tryna tell me how to live)\r\nWhite boy, white boy, in your cop car\r\n(But I don\'t listen to her, \'cause my head is like a sieve)\r\nWhite boy, white boy, you\'re untouchable\r\n(The world\'s coming to an end, I don\'t even care)\r\nNobody can tell me shit \'cause I\'m a big rockstar\r\n\r\nSeems like the average lifespan of a white man\r\nIs more than twice than a black life span\r\nI wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner\r\nI feel like checking out on life, can\'t escape this circumstance\r\nI\'d rather hear \'em say \"Die N-word\" than Die Antwoord\r\nNinja, now it\'s better disguised banter\r\nBut that\'s life, strapped \'cause we\'re strapped financially\r\nAnd can\'t find answers\r\nWe\'re applying, but McDonald\'s\r\nSeems to be the only franchise that\'ll hire\r\nSo how can we have higher standards?\r\nAs Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter\r\nWe fight back with violence but acts like that are\r\nBlack eyes on the movement\r\nWhich makes black lives madder\r\nAt cops and cops madder\r\nThat\'s why it\'s at a stalemate\r\nCan\'t arrive at a compromise so it\'s Black Ops\r\nI wonder if we hire more black cops, the crap stops\r\nThe block is our backyards, officers, not the crack spot\r\nCall the attack dogs off of us, man\r\nYou always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop\r\nAnd bad cops fuck it up for the good cops, and man, stop\r\nSendin\' white cops in the black neighborhoods\r\nWho ain\'t acclimated to \'em, like that\'s the way to do it\r\nWho seen some fuckin\' videos of rappers waving guns\r\nAnd know nobody black so they act afraid of us\r\nAnd that\'s racism, the fear that a black face gives \'em\r\nA subconscious racist\r\nWait, why are there black neighborhoods?\r\n\'Cause America segregated us, designated us to an area\r\nSeparated us, Section-Eight\'d us\r\nWhen we tear it ups, the only time attention\'s paid to us\r\nAnd education sucks, and every day\'s another\r\nFreddie Gray for us, a levy breaks or fuzz\r\n\r\nWhy is it they treat us like dryer lint?\r\nWe just want a safe environment for our kids\r\nBut can\'t escape the sirens\r\nDon\'t take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in\r\nThe poverty that we face so the crime rate\'s the highest in\r\nThe lowest classes, it\'s like a razor wire fence\r\nAnd we\'re trapped in these racial biases\r\nThat plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise\r\nEvery time we see a devil\'s face\r\nLions, tigers, and bears, oh my-\r\nIt\'s more like billy clubs and gats\r\nAnd we really love it when you think we\'re guilty \'cause we\'re black\r\n\"But you kill each other, facts\r\nYou peel each other\'s caps, for silly stuff like hats\"\r\nSingle mother strugglin\' through substance abuse\r\nWhile people with nothin\' to lose shoot each other for shoes\r\nFuck your Republican views\r\nPull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck are the boots?\r\nAnd streets act as a narrator, don\'t gotta read comics\r\nOr be that into characters, just to see that, just to be black\r\nYou better be strapped with a derringer\r\nOr be \"capped in America\" like Steve Rogers\r\n\'Cause no one oversees these cops and\r\nAll we see is \'em beat charges\r\nWe done seen \'em beat Rodney King unconscious, and got off\r\nSo we don\'t need all you crooked police officers\' peace offerings\r\nJust keep marchin\', \'til we reach congress\r\nBut they\'re gonna say you\'re tryin\' to take an irrational stance\r\nIf you try to slander the flag but\r\nSomebody has to be the sacrificial lamb\r\nSo they call it a Kaepernick tantrum\r\nIf you don\'t stand for the national anthem\r\nWe raise it, you better praise it\r\nOr you\'ll be made to feel like a traitor, we\'ll\r\nTreat you like Rodney Dangerfield\r\nHome of the brave is still racist \'ville\r\nSo this whole nation feels like a plantation field\r\nIn a country that claims that its foundation was based on\r\nUnited States ideals that had its Natives killed\r\nGot you singin\' this star-spangled spiel\r\nTo a piece of cloth that represents the \"Land of the Free\"\r\nThat made people slaves to build', 'YES', 37),
